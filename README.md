# Heart-Rate-Monitor
We design a heart rate monitor by using Honeywell pressure sensor and STMF429D microcontroller
We have used the Platform IDE on VScode
We get the Pressure changes from the cuff and based on that we calculate the Systolic and Diastolic pressures to finally calculate the Heart rate.
