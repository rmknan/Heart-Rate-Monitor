# Heart-Rate-Monitor
We design a heart rate monitor by using Honeywell pressure sensor and STMF429D microcontroller.

We have used the Platform IDE on VScode.

We get the Pressure changes from the cuff and based on that we calculate the Systolic and Diastolic pressures to finally calculate the Heart rate.
